# file_pikker

A file picker study based on the example provided in the [`file-picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker) package. The goal for this study was to pick an image from the local storage, save it to the app's storage, and display the image within the app.

## what I learned

I had some problems getting the picked picture to update. I solved this problem by...

## installation

```
flutter pub get
```

## known issues

This project has only ever been built for Android. There is no guarantee that it can be built for iOS.
